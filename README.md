# shared-info
Repository created for sharing information among the Helsinki-NLP participants and interested users.
Commenced by means of organizing the reading group sessions but intended for general purposes. Feel free to participate, add and modify information here.

## Reading group
In a nutshell, on every session one of the participants will present 1 research article wich we will further discuss after the presentation. 

We shall meet on a bi-weekly basis in the coffee room on the 6th floor of MetsÃ¤talo (unless otherwise stated). 

**NOTE:** *Fixed day and time for the following will be discussed on the 1st meeting* 
> For this to work smoothly, it is highly recommendable that all the attendants to a session had read the paper in turn.
